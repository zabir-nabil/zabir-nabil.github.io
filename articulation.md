## [](#header-2)Articulation Point

### [](#header-3) Definition

> Articulation point or cut vertex is some node in a Graph such that, if that node (and all edges associated with it)
> are deleted, the number of components in the initial graph increases (If the graph was connected
> before now it will form multiple disconnected components).
